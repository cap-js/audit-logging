## About this project

`@cap-js/audit-logging` is a CDS plugin providing integration to the SAP Audit Log service as well as out-of-the-box personal data-related audit logging based on annotations.

Documentation can be found at [cap.cloud.sap](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy).

## Requirements

See [Getting Started](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started) on how to jumpstart your development and grow as you go with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.

The end-to-end out-of-the-box functionality provided by this plugin requires a paid-for instance of the [SAP Audit Log service for customers](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/audit-log-write-api-for-customers?locale=en-US). However, it is possible to provide an own implementation that writes the audit logs to a custom store.
